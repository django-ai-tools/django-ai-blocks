# Vision & Overview
The "Django-AI-Blocks" App Framework is the foundation for building modular, intelligent, and reusable business interfaces.

It reimagines how Django applications present and interact with data—transforming traditional views into a composable “Block” architecture, where each block represents a functional, permission-aware UI component that can be dropped anywhere in the system.

The framework aims to become an internal low-code platform for the organization —where developers build new modules by defining models and workflows,
and the UI is generated dynamically through blocks and layouts.

Ultimately, users will design dashboards, reports, and workflows through an AI-assisted interface, bridging the gap between data, design, and decision-making.

# Core Vision
To create a configurable, workflow-aware, AI-ready UI platform where every data view—table, form, chart, Gantt, Kanban, or dashboard—is a block that can be registered, rendered, and reused across multiple domains (production, procurement, engineering, projects, etc.).
This architecture allows developers and power users to assemble applications visually, without duplicating code or violating domain boundaries.

# Architectural Pillars
**Blocks as Building Units**
Each block encapsulates its data source, permissions, display rules, and front-end template logic. Blocks can render dynamic Tables, Forms, Charts, or Gantt views with minimal configuration.

**Layouts as Composers**
Layouts (or pages) organize blocks by drag/drop mechanism. A layout is a “screen definition” built entirely by referencing reusable blocks.

**Registry-Driven Design**
Every block registers itself into a centralized registry, making it discoverable and plug-and-play. Domain apps contribute their own blocks via registration hooks.

**User Personalization**
Users can persist column configurations, filters, and view preferences through BlockColumnConfig and BlockFilterConfig, giving them a truly personalized experience.

**Integrated Governance**
The block engine integrates with the Permissions and Workflow layers—enforcing field-level visibility, edit rights, and state-based restrictions automatically.

# Long-Term Goal
To evolve the system into an AI-assisted interface builder where blocks can be discovered, combined, and configured through natural language or contextual prompts—bridging the gap between business logic and user experience.
